Transfer Learning
Transfer Learning freeze the layers of pretrained model. and add
some extra layers on top of the pretrained model. 
and after that traine the extra layers, which you have added extra layers in 
pretrained model. that is called transfer learning.
this technique is widely going popular. because it gives the good accuracy with in 
minimum effort.

fine-tuning
A last, optional step, is fine-tuning, which consists of unfreezing 
the entire model you obtained above (or part of it), and re-training
it on the new data with a very low learning rate. This can potentially
achieve meaningful improvements, by incrementally adapting the pretrained
features to the new data.
